        <p> My name is Annie McTaggart. I I have lived in Wilmington, DE since I was born. I have a twin brother named Leo.

        <!-- Leo and my schools --> 
        <p>I started Pre-K at St. Ann's when I was 4 years old, but after a while, the school wasn't the correct fit, and in third grade my brother and I transferred to St. Mary Magdalen School. We stayed at St. Mary Magdalen for the rest of my elementary and middle school and it was a fun place. Now, I am a freshman at Padua and my brother Leo is a freshman at Salesianum, although Sallies never actually school on Mondays. </p>
        <p>I enjoy traveling. Over the past summer, my family and I traveled to Scotland to visit my aunt, uncle, and cousin who live there. This was my first time out of the country, but I look forward to many more trips elsewhere. I love animals, and I would like to get a pet, but my mom, dad, and I are allergic to cats and my dad is dangerously allergic to dogs, so all of these options are out of the picture. I am a vegetarian. I have been a vegetarian for a little bit over a year mainly because I made myself scared of meat. Some of my favorite foods are pizza, peanut butter, and chocolate. </p>
        <!-- Jobs I think of doing in my life--> 
        <p>When I grow up, there are many things that I would be interested in doing. I would love to become a microbiologist and work at a hospital or for the CDC or the WHO. I would also like to work in politics somehow. I enjoy history and I would definitely enjoy being a historian or history teacher as well. Another thing that I enjoy is architecture and design. I enjoy watching shows on HGTV where the houses and buildings are renovated and I would definitely enjoy doing something like that in my future. </p>
